// Seth - I have left this App.js in the root or now since it
//        is the entry point and since we are using create-react-app
//        it is not eacy to change the entry point so this file
//        should not be moved. (Please correct me if someone knows
//        how to move it, as it should probably go into our SRC folder.)

// Seth - To add another Route just create it in the routes folder
//        then import above and add to the RootStack below.
